"D3 Angular Demos" is a playground I built as I was preparing for a talk I gave at the [AngularJS OC Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-OC/") about D3 and AngularJS. It includes directives for some basic visualizations.


If these directives are in any way useful to you, go ahead and use them to your heart's content. As I come up with new demos I will be adding them to the project. Feel free to clone or fork the repo. If you find any bugs, please open an issue. Oh and, pull requests are welcome :).

### Hacking on this:
I built this app using [Yeoman]("http://yeoman.io"). Follow the instructions on the homepage to have Yeoman installed, which will install [Grunt]("http://gruntjs.com") [Bower]("http://bower.io") automatically. Note that you will need Node.js, Git, and Ruby and Compass (for Sass watching).

Once you have those installed, in the directory simply run: 

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt serve

and that should open a browser for you with live reloading ready. Happy coding!
